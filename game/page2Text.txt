Halpin retired from sea life and bought Tinakilly House in Wicklow. The name Tinakilly is derived from the townland of Tinakilly on which the house is built. It comes from the Gaelic; Ti equals house: na equals of the: Coille equals wood. So the whole name in Irish means "House of the Wood". The house was built by Halpin. The British Government gave him a blank cheque to build his new home in gratitude for his contribution to improving world communications and therefore world trade. He employed James Franklin Fuller, who was quite popular at the time, to design the house. The timber was imported from London and the firplace was imported from Italy. The cellar has enough room for 2000 bottles of wine.The total cost of Halpin’s mansion was £40000 (about £4m in todays value)Halpin became involved in local politics and stood for parliament but was not successful. However Tinakilly house was a useful asset during his campaign for entertaining guests and learning political skills. One of Halpins earliest visitors was Alfred Lord Tennyson who is reputed to have read “In Memoriam” to a party of invited nuns.There is an obelisk that stands in Fitzwilliam Square, Wicklow, that pays tribute to Robert Halpin and the work he did.Halpin died at the age of 58, having survived many years as a sailor, from blood poisoning after cutting his toe.
