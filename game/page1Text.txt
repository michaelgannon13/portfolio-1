Robert Halpin was born in Wicklow town in 1836. He was the youngest of 13 children.Young Halpin never took much of an interest in education because his passion was sailing and the sea.He left home at 10 to become a seafarer.
In 1858 Halpin Captained a steam-ship called the Propellor travelling from Ireland to America In 1859 while in control of a ship called ‘The Argo’ he shipwrecked off Newfoundland. Nobody was hurt however Halpin lost his masters for 9 months.
In 1865 he was appointed chief officer of ‘The SS Great Eastern’ the world’s biggest ship. The ships purpose was to lay telegraph cable across the Atlantic from Ireland to the U.S. The problem with the S.S. Great Eastern was that she was never filled to full capacity and was losing money. The vessel was sold in 1867 to a company that wanted to use the ship to bring American visitors to the Paris World Exibition.
The SS Great Eastern was 693 feet in length (over 200 metres) 22,500 tons dead weight and had passenger accommodation for over 3000 passengers. Five times larger than any other ship then built, she had six masts named Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday Thursday, Friday and Saturday, five funnels, 6500 yards of sail, two 58 ft paddle wheels, a 24 ft screw (which remains the biggest ever built) and a coal carrying capacity of 15000 tons. 
During Halpin’s first cable-laying process the cables broke after 1660 miles, just short of halfway across. They tried again the following year this time with success.  Halpin somehow managed to navigate to the old telegraph cable which was inn2000 ft. of water and reattatching it.
