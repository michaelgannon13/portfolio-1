                           <p>A private investigator has been convicted on two charges of illegally obtaining information from the Garda Pulse system and fined a total of €5,000.
Michael J Gaynor, trading as MJG Investigations, Beatty Grove, Celbridge, Co Kildare, was before Dublin District Court facing a prosecution by the Data Protection Commissioner.</p><p>
Mr Gaynor (62), a former garda, faced three charges of illegally accessing personal information held by An Garda Síochána and of disclosing it without authority, under the provisions of section 22 (1) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.
                                He was convicted on two of those charges and fined €2,500 for each offence.</p><p>
Some 72 criminal charges in total against Mr Gaynor related to alleged breaches of data protection legislation, including illegally accessing and disclosing personal information on individuals held by An Garda Síochána and the ESB.
A total of 69 were taken into consideration in sentencing.</p><p>
Remy Farrell SC for the Data Protection Commissioner told the court Mr Gaynor had provided tracing reports to three credit unions - in Balbriggan, Lucan and Citybus Credit Union - on individuals they hoped to take action against for non-payment of debts.</p><p>
                                
                                He had allegedly obtained the information from Detective Garda Paul Cullen, a member of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, who had “little cause to be accessing information” on the three individuals concerned between May and October of last year.</p>
The court heard that three tracing reports provided to credit unions contained information such as names, addresses, vehicle registration details and, in the case of one of the individuals, information on a drink-driving conviction.
In the case of each of the three reports, information in them coincided with information accessed on Garda systems a few days earlier by Det Garda Cullen.

                            <p>Using nano-technology to synthesise artificial molecules, Tel Aviv-based StoreDot says it has developed a battery that can store a much higher charge more quickly, in effect acting like a super-dense sponge to soak up power and retain it.
</p><p>While the prototype is currently far too bulky for a mobile phone, the company believes it will be ready by 2016 to market a slim battery that can absorb and deliver a day's power for a smartphone in just 30 seconds.</p><p>
"These are new materials, they have never been developed before," said Doron Myersdorf, the founder and chief executive of StoreDot, whose investors include Russian billionaire and Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich.The innovation is based around the creation of "nanodots", which StoreDot describes as bio-organic peptide molecules.</p><p>Nanodots alter the way a battery behaves to allow the rapid absorption and, critically, the retention of power.
The company has raised $48m (€38.6m) from two rounds of funding, including backing from a leading mobile phone maker. </p><p>Mr Myersdorf declined to name the company, but said it was Asian.
With the number of smartphone users forecast to reach 1.75 billion this year, StoreDot sees a big market, and some experts think that, with more work, it could be on to a winner.
"We live in a power hungry world ... people are constantly chasing a power outlet. <p><p>StoreDot has the potential to solve this real big problem," said Zack Weisfeld, who has worked with and evaluated ventures in the mobile phone sector globally."They still have some way to go, to deal with size of battery and power cycle rounds, but if solvable, it's a very big breakthrough," he said. </p><p>A power cycle round refers to the number of times a battery can be re-charged in its lifetime.
Mr Myersdorf said a fast-charge phone would cost €80-€120 more than current models and would ultimately be able to handle 1,500 recharge/discharge cycles, giving it about three years of life.
</p><p>He hopes to use the same technology to create a car battery that recharges in two or three minutes, rather than current models which commonly need to be charged overnight.

                            <p>The players and staff of a Spanish football team have stepped in to rescue an 85-year-old woman from homelessness after her flat was repossessed.
Carmen Martínez was evicted from her home in the Madrid district of Vallecas on Friday, because she was the guarantor of a debt her son had taken on from a private lender and which he was unable to pay back.</p><p> The scenes of Ms Martínez crying as she was escorted from her home and of angry neighbours appealing in vain to the police to stop the eviction went viral.“We’re not going to do nothing, we’re going to help that lady,” said Paco Jémez, coach of local first division team Rayo Vallecano, on Saturday.</p><p> “Not just me, but the whole coaching staff and the players.”
Mr Jémez and his staff agreed to pay an unspecified monthly sum to Ms Martínez in order for her to be able to rent a new home. The basic terms were agreed on when Ms Martinez, who was widowed seven years ago, met with the coach and representatives of an anti-eviction organisation at Rayo Vallecano’s ground.</p><p>“I’m very proud to be able to give a hand,” Mr Jémez said. “I’d like to help more people, but it’s impossible. In this particular case, because it’s a local lady, we as a club can’t pass up the chance to help.”
Ms Martínez’s son, Luis Jiménez, took out the €40,000 private loan in 2010, after his bank refused his request for credit.</p><p> His family says he needed the money to get through financial difficulties after a divorce and losing his job, and also to renovate his home. However, he failed to pay the sum back and with the accumulated interest the debt rose to €77,000. The terms of the loan meant that his mother’s property, valued at €160,000, was liable for foreclosure.</p><p>“I didn’t know anything about it,” Ms Martínez told El País newspaper. “I don’t know how to read or write, all I can do is sign my name. So I asked my neighbour to help me [read the contract] and that was when we found out.”
The Spanish government and Madrid City Hall have also got involved, each promising they will help find new accommodation for Ms Martínez, who receives a monthly pension of €630.</p><p>
Evictions have been one of the most visible effects of Spain’s recent economic crisis, which was in great part caused by an overheated property sector. An unemployment rate which is still at 24 percent and strict mortgage laws have meant that tens of thousands of families have lost their homes.</p><p>
Last year, the government introduced changes to the law, after intense campaigning by activists. However, new figures show that the number of evictions from occupied homes increased 17 percent in the first half of 2014 compared to the same period a year earlier.</p>
